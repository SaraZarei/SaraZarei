### 🔍 About Me
I’m a results-driven **Data Analytics Engineer** with strong hands-on experience building reliable **data models**, **ETL/ELT pipelines**, and **KPI-ready marts** that power analytics and decision-making. I also work as a **Data Analyst**, translating business questions into clear metrics, dashboards, and insights with strong SQL and data storytelling. In addition, I have a solid foundation in **Data Science and Machine Learning**, including practical experience with supervised/unsupervised models (classification, regression, clustering) to support predictive and segmentation use cases.

### 💼 What I Do

🧱 **Analytics Engineering**: Build **clean, documented, and scalable data models** (staging → intermediate → marts) with consistent KPI definitions, canonical keys, and data quality checks (dbt-style modular SQL).

🔄 **Data Engineering (ELT/ETL)**: Design and maintain reliable pipelines with **Python + SQL**, ingestion from APIs/files, incremental loads, deduplication strategies, and schema design (**3NF + Star/Snowflake** where appropriate).

✅ **Data Quality & Observability**: Implement validation rules (null/format checks, anomaly flags, freshness/lag monitoring), and create “trust layers” so downstream dashboards don’t break or lie.

📊 **Data Analysis & BI**: Translate business questions into metrics and dashboards; deliver actionable insights using **BigQuery/SQL**, and visualization tools like **Power BI / Tableau / Looker Studio**.

☁️ **Cloud Data Platforms**: Work with cloud-native analytics stacks (e.g., **BigQuery**, object storage, orchestration) and optimize cost/performance with partitioning, clustering, and query design.

🧩 **Business & Growth Analytics**: Unify cross-channel data (e-commerce, ads, web/app analytics, CRM) and build KPI layers for revenue, AOV, conversion, retention, and cohort reporting.
