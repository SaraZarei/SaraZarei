### 🔍 About Me

I'm a results-driven data professional with hands-on experience across the full data lifecycle — from data ingestion and transformation to modeling, analysis, and deployment. I have built **ETL pipelines**, designed **normalized relational schemas**, worked with **NoSQL document stores**, and developed machine learning models for **classification, regression, and clustering** tasks.

While my main goal is to grow as a **Data Engineer**, I bring strong analytical thinking and deep knowledge of **data science concepts**, which gives me an edge in understanding both **data infrastructure** and **insights**.

### 💼 What I Do

- 🔄 **Data Engineering**: Design and build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines using Airflow, Python, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, with strong focus on data validation, staging, and schema design (3NF, Star, and Snowflake)
- ☁️ **Cloud & IaC**: Deploy and orchestrate workflows using AWS Lambda, S3, EventBridge, and CloudWatch, with infrastructure automated via Terraform
- 📈 **Data Analytics**: Perform exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, API-based data sourcing, and deliver business insights through visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Domo
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Build and evaluate supervised and unsupervised models for real-world prediction/classification/segmentation
- 📊 **Digital Marketing Analytics**: Analyze performance of B2B/B2C campaigns, clean and unify data across CRMs and third-party tools, and drive insights that support business decision-making
